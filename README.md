# Quiz App Android Mobile
 Basic quiz application to help me learn android mobile development

## About The Project
Enter your name, and see how many questions you are able to get correct. A simple quiz application with 10 predefined questions.

This was my 3rd project in my journey of learning android mobile development. This application helped me learn about switching between different views and taking data to the different views. As well as dymically displaying the data for each question from a list of data classes created.

This project raise some questions on how would I be able to dynamically load questions, save questions created by the user for later, and about getting data in from an API endpoint. These issues were out of scope of this project for now, but are issues that will need to be takled in the future on my learning journey.
